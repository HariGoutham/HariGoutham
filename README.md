# 🌟 Personal Proof of Concept (PoC) for Microservices-Based Food Delivery Application

Inspired by the **Crédit Agricole project**, this repository showcases a **full-stack microservices-based food delivery application** designed and implemented using **Angular**, **Spring Boot**, and **Minikube**, among other cutting-edge technologies.

The application integrates **Eureka Server** for service discovery, **Nginx** as a reverse proxy, and **ArgoCD** for continuous deployment. **Docker** and **Kubernetes** are used for containerization, and automated **CI/CD pipelines** are built with **Jenkins**, **Docker Hub**, and **GitHub Actions**.

### 🛠 Key Technologies:
- **Frontend:** 🌐 [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- **Backend:** 🖥 [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- **Microservices:** 🧩 Eureka Server, Spring Cloud
- **Containerization:** 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), Minikube
- **Continuous Deployment:** 🚀 [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- **Service Proxy:** 🔁 [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- **Cloud & Database (AWS):** 🌩 [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [ALB](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/applicationloadbalancer/), [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### ☁️ Migration to AWS:

The application was later **migrated to AWS**, utilizing **AWS EKS** for container orchestration, **ALB** for load balancing, and **AWS RDS** and **MongoDB** for database management. A secure **CI/CD pipeline** was established using **Jenkins** and **SonarQube** to ensure robust deployments.
